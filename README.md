# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple web-based game called "Guess the Number." The game allows players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

1. The game generates a random number between a specified minimum and maximum range (inclusive).
2. The player needs to enter their guess in the input field and submit it.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess was too low or too high.
4. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the random number.
5. Once the correct number is guessed, the game displays a congratulatory message with the number of attempts made.
6. The player can then choose to play again and start a new game with a new random number.
